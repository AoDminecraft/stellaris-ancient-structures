# Technologies
tech_tdi_ancient_gateway: "Ancient Gateway Activation"
tech_tdi_ancient_gateway_desc: "Our analysis of ancient data fragments has revealed the existence of a dormant gateway network, separate from the L-Gate system. This gateway leads to something called the 'Ancient Cluster' - a hidden region of space that may contain the key to ultimate power."

tech_tdi_zpm_extraction: "ZPM Extraction Technology"
tech_tdi_zpm_extraction_desc: "The Ancient Cluster contains deposits of Zero Point Modules - power sources of unimaginable potency. We can build facilities to extract and harness these artifacts."

# Events - Gateway Discovery
tdi_ancient_cluster.5.name: "Ancient Gateway Discovered"
tdi_ancient_cluster.5.desc: "Our deep space scanners have detected an unusual structure in the [ancient_gateway_system.GetName] system. It appears to be some kind of gateway, similar to the L-Gates but of a completely different design.\n\nUnlike the L-Gates, this structure is dormant but shows signs of recent use - perhaps within the last million years. Ancient inscriptions around its frame reference a 'Hidden Sanctuary' and 'Ultimate Power.'\n\nWith the proper technology, we may be able to reactivate this gateway and discover what lies beyond."
tdi_ancient_cluster.5.a: "Chart a course. We must investigate this."

# Events - Gateway Restoration
tdi_ancient_cluster.10.name: "Gateway Restoration Begins"
tdi_ancient_cluster.10.desc: "Our engineering teams have begun the painstaking work of restoring the Ancient Gateway. The technology is incredibly sophisticated - far beyond even the L-Gates.\n\nPreliminary analysis suggests the gateway connects to a completely separate region of space, isolated from the rest of the galaxy. Whatever civilization built this clearly wanted to keep something hidden... or protected."
tdi_ancient_cluster.10.a: "Continue the work."
tdi_gateway_restoration_begun: "§YThe Ancient Gateway is being restored. Once complete, you will gain access to the Ancient Cluster.§!"

# Events - Gateway Activation
tdi_ancient_cluster.20.name: "THE ANCIENT CLUSTER ACCESSED"
tdi_ancient_cluster.20.desc: "The gateway ROARS to life, its power signature dwarfing anything we've seen before. As the aperture stabilizes, our sensors detect... paradise.\n\nSeven pristine systems, each centered around a pulsar or neutron star. Gaia worlds orbit in perfect harmony, their atmospheres thick with life. And beneath the surface of these stars, we detect something extraordinary:\n\n§YZero Point Modules§! - Power sources that could fuel our Apocalypse Engine!\n\nThis cluster was hidden for a reason. The ancient civilization that built it stored their ultimate power source here, safely tucked away from the rest of the galaxy.\n\nNow it's ours."
tdi_ancient_cluster.20.a: "Secure the cluster. Immediately."
tdi_ancient_cluster_generated: "§YThe Ancient Cluster has been generated! 7 new systems are now accessible through the Ancient Gateway. Each system contains valuable Gaia worlds and potential ZPM extraction sites.§!"

# Events - First Entry
tdi_ancient_cluster.200.name: "Paradise Found"
tdi_ancient_cluster.200.desc: "Our fleet emerges into the Ancient Cluster and... it's breathtaking.\n\nGaia worlds as far as sensors can detect. Perfect atmospheres, ideal temperatures, thriving ecosystems. This place was designed as a sanctuary.\n\nBut more importantly, our scientists detect massive quantum anomalies within each star. These anomalies are §YZero Point Module deposits§! - the ancient civilization must have seeded them throughout the cluster.\n\nWith the proper technology, we could extract these ZPMs and use them to power... anything. Even our Apocalypse Engine."
tdi_ancient_cluster.200.a: "Begin research immediately."
tdi_ancient_cluster_explore: "§Y ZPM Extraction Technology§! is now available for research."

# Events - ZPM Facility Complete
tdi_ancient_cluster.300.name: "ZPM Production Online"
tdi_ancient_cluster.300.desc: "The ZPM Extraction Facility is operational. Quantum drilling arrays bore into the star's core, carefully extracting Zero Point Modules from the subspace matrix.\n\nEach ZPM contains enough energy to power a planet for a millennium. With multiple facilities operational, we'll have the power needed for our ultimate ambitions."
tdi_ancient_cluster.300.a: "Excellent."
tdi_zpm_production_online: "§YThis facility will produce 2 ZPMs per month.§!"

Our ZPM production has dropped below the Apocalypse Engine's consumption rate!\n\nIf we cannot secure enough ZPMs, the Engine will begin to fail. Its reality-warping systems require continuous ZPM input to remain stable.\n\n§RWe must reclaim the Ancient Cluster or face Engine shutdown!§!"
tdi_ancient_cluster.400.a: "Mobilize all available forces!"
