- Uses custom namespace (`tdi_`) to avoid conflicts

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

This mod is designed for players who want:

- Powerful late-game megastructures without placement restrictions
- High resource costs balanced by significant benefits
- Progression-based unlocks requiring strategic planning
- *Optional* extreme late-game challenges and opportunities

## ⚠️ Warnings

- These megastructures are **expensive** - plan your economy accordingly
- Some content may significantly alter your relationship with other empires
- **There is no undo** for certain late-game decisions
- Save often, especially when experimenting with advanced features

## 🔧 Known Issues

- Some advanced features are still in development

- Victory conditions may not trigger correctly (in testing)
- Localization is English only (contributions welcome!)
